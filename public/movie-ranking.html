<h2>The Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Edward Penishands</h3>
This beautifually somber drama makes sense but is clearly meant to be carried by the lead.
<h3>Crazy Rich Asians...That Fuck</h3>
A sharp comedy about racial commodification...just kidding, it's mostly smoking hot hardcore Asian sex. Win!
<h3>Alvin and the Chipmunks 2; The Squeakquel</h3>
A low-key but powerfully affecting urban drama that tells a familiar story — of drugs, power and respect on the inner-city streets — with such unusual authenticity and dramatic force that it’s as if we’re seeing it for the first time. Much of that impact is due to the presence of Alvin, a real-life chipmunk who makes his acting debut as a dramatized version of himself, a kind of gangsta Othello who rules his kingdom with a fair but unwavering hand. Building on the promise already evident in the first movie, “Alvin and the Chipmunks,” this strongly assured sophomore effort is probably too bleak and rough-edged to make much of an impact in the commercial arena, but should be championed by discerning critics and adventurous fests following its Tribeca world premiere.
