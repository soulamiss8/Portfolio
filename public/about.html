<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Short, pale and average at best.</p>

<p>Just tried to kill a fruitfly on my compuer screen and missed. I don't know where all these fruit flies are coming from. The confusion is not in knowing where they could come from, it's in narrowing down the abundance of sources. I haven't cleaned a toilet in 8 years, it's been months since I've vaccumed, trash stays in the can for 4 weeks before I throw it out, every wall and windown in my house has an open hole to the outside world, recently a dog had severe diarrhea in my house and I only kinda cleaned it up, etc... </p>

<p>I paused the Daily Show to focus on that last paragraph. It's a Jon Stewart episode. I only watch Jon Stewart episodes. Currently he has Tristan Harris on. Never heard of him. Ask me about the time I wrote about this episode, I won't know what you're talking about or remember any of the epsiode or this writing. </p>
